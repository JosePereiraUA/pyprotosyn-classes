# Laboratório de Visualização e Computação Científica
Welcome to the LVCC module on "Computational design of proteins". The present repository serves as a basis for the work on this module, and should be built upon and improved in order to fulfill the class challenges.
The package main class (Molecule) is a directed graph, able to hold and manipulate information in both cartesian and internal coordinates.
